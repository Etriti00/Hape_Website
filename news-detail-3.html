The activity, aimed at strengthening cross-border collaboration in criminal matters, brought together law enforcement and judicial officials from Kosovo and Albania.

The training was designed and led by short-term experts Maurizio Varanese, Chief Inspector of the Italian Police, and Emanuele Marchisio, an Italian Prosecutor, alongside Mr. Marco Mosele, Judicial Cooperation Officer from Eurojust. Participants engaged in interactive sessions combining theoretical and practical components focused on Schengen instruments, international coordination mechanisms, and the establishment of Joint Investigation Teams (JITs).

This initiative is part of HAPE’s ongoing commitment to support Kosovo authorities in enhancing operational and legal capacities for effective international police and judicial cooperation, contributing to stronger regional security and justice cooperation frameworks.</p>

                    The Home Affairs Programme of the European Union in Kosovo (HAPE) Project, successfully concluded a two-day High-Level Workshop on Non-Conviction-Based Confiscation (NCBC). The initiative was attended by senior representatives of the Government of Kosovo, the judiciary, and law enforcement agencies, together with the European Union and experts from EU Member States.

                    The workshop featured keynote interventions on the Italian and French models, operational insights from Eurojust, and practical case studies illustrating the added value of NCBC in asset recovery and judicial cooperation from Special Anti-Corruption and Organized Crime Structure of Albania, as well as, senior representatives of Kosovar institutions, the European Commission, judicial and law enforcement authorities from EU Member States.

                    The event was conceived as a high-level institutional forum to stimulate debate on this strategic issue, present comparative European models, and consolidate cross-border cooperation in the fight against organised crime and corruption. It aims to support Kosovo in strengthening its asset recovery system and aligning it with European standards in the fight against organised crime and corruption

                <p style="color: #001489; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; text-align: justify;">
                    In their opening remarks, Ms. Ilaria Renelli, HAPE Project Team Leader highlighted the importance of "follow the money" principle in financial investigation and asset recovery, Mr. Jarmo Feliks Helppikangas, Head of Rule of Law & Legal, Human Rights, European Union Special Representative in Kosovo, stressed the importance of asset confiscation as a cornerstone of rule-of-law reforms and a key element of Kosovo's EU integration path. Whereas, Kosovo Acting Minister of Justice, Mr. Blerim Sallahu, underlined Kosovo's determination to advance reforms that increase the effectiveness of confiscation mechanisms and close existing gaps in the legal framework.

                    Mr. Filippo Romano, Secretary-General, Italian National Anti-Corruption Authority (ANAC)<br>
                    Mr. Aldo Ingangi, Magistrate, Eurojust<br>
                    General Vincenzo Molinese, Commander, Carabinieri Special Operations Department (ROS)<br>

                    This initiative builds on the 2024 European Commission Report on Kosovo, which called for enhanced confiscation mechanisms, particularly in high-level corruption and complex financial crime cases. By the conclusion of the workshop, Kosovo and its partners aim to reinforce inter-agency cooperation, strengthen institutional readiness, and set a roadmap for reforms in line with the EU acquis.

The initiative aligns with HAPE's ongoing efforts to support Kosovo authorities in strengthening cross-border collaboration in criminal matters.

The training, held on 8 and 9 July 2025 at Hotel Sirius in Pristina, was designed and led by short-term experts Maurizio Varanese, Chief Inspector of the Italian Police, and Angela Continisio, an Italian Prosecutor, alongside Mr. Marco Mosele, Judicial Cooperation Officer from Eurojust. A total of 15 law enforcement representatives attended, including ten from Kosovo Police and five from the North Macedonia Police.

Participants engaged in an intensive programme combining theoretical insights with practical exercises based on a detailed and realistic cross-border criminal scenario. Key topics addressed included the application of Schengen instruments such as hot pursuit and cross-border surveillance, the role of international bodies like EUROPOL and EUROJUST in facilitating cooperation, as well as the establishment and management of Joint Investigation Teams (JITs).

The training facilitated in-depth exploration of legislative frameworks, procedures, and operational tools necessary for effective international cooperation. Participants gained hands-on experience through simulated operational meetings, enhancing their capacity to organize and coordinate cross-border investigative activities.

In parallel, HAPE experts initiated a preliminary assessment of Kosovo’s existing domestic legal instruments and operational mechanisms that enable effective international police and judicial cooperation. Constructive meetings were held with senior police and judicial officials, providing valuable insights and laying the groundwork for future improvements in Kosovo’s cooperation framework.

The training concluded successfully, with participants demonstrating strong engagement and a significant increase in both theoretical understanding and practical operational skills. Additional trainings and consultations will be conducted in October and November 2025, further consolidating Kosovo’s capacity in international criminal cooperation.

The HAPE Project remains committed to fostering regional stability through enhanced law enforcement and judicial collaboration.</p>

In presence of EU office, advisors of PM’S office, the director of EMA, representatives from ARKEP, Kosovo Police, Firefighting, Emergency Medical services, Telecom operators IPKO and VALA, Information Society Agency, Ministry of Defence (CITCEN), a comprehensive technical, operational and financial analysis was provided by the Austrian expert, Gregor JANIN. He was leading similar studies and implementations of the NG 112-emergency number services, in North-Macedonia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albania. It is important to highlight that the HAPE project had an outstanding level of commitment and cooperation from all Kosovar stakeholders. To be part of the European Union critical communications system (EUCCS) that will be established and mandatory in 2030, incl. the future NG-112 will offer to the public to be able to reach the safety agencies with an emergency call, but also allow the emergency Agencies to reach officers and units engaged in a secure prioritized mission critical radio and telephone interoperable network and in any crisis situation, it will give to Governments the capability to reach a large number of citizens simultaneously with the Public warning (EU-ALERT system). Following that study, in coordination with a EU TAIEX mission to start in October 2025, all stakeholders will continue to work in synergies, to boost the building of this secure and resilient communication system, for the benefit of the population.</p>

To deliver this important capacity-building initiative, HAPE engaged a highly qualified French expert – a former chief of boat with 13 years of operational experience and a certified expert diver for over 12 years. The objective of the training was to enhance practical skills in waterborne operations and to ensure safe and coordinated navigation in inland waters (lakes). The four-day training was held at Batlava Lake, where a dedicated floating dock was installed on 7 July to support hands-on exercises. A total of 10 officers from the Kosovo Police, 4 officers from Kosovo Customs, and 2 representatives from EMA participated in this intensive course. The training covered a wide range of essential competencies, including safe navigation techniques, man overboard procedures, knot-tying techniques, mooring and securing vessels, and other critical safety protocols necessary for professional waterborne patrol operations. Special emphasis was placed on teamwork, situational awareness, and responding effectively in emergency scenarios.
Participants demonstrated a high level of interest, professionalism, and motivation throughout the training, underscoring both the relevance and timeliness of this initiative.
This activity reflects HAPE’s continued commitment to strengthening operational capacity and inter-agency cooperation among Kosovo’s border and emergency management institutions, in line with European standards for border security and public safety.

This working group, held on January 24-26, 2025, focused on drafting the annexes to the National Response Plan, which was adopted in December 2023.

                                        Under the leadership of Mr. Mustaf Gashi, with the presence of Mr. Gent Metaj, General Director of EMA, the working group gathered 14 participants from various ministries. These activities are aligned with both the National Development Plan and the Performance Plan.
                                        
                                        The focus of the discussions was on emergency support texts, which define the roles and responsibilities of the institutions based on their primary and support roles during emergencies. This session specifically dealt with procedures related to transport and communication, crucial components in ensuring a coordinated response during crises.
                                        
                                        The HAPE Project is proud to support the EMA, in strengthening Kosovo’s emergency management capacities and enhancing the national response plan framework.</p>
