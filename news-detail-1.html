                                        <li>Evaluating the implementation of the previous communication strategy.</li>

                                        <li>Setting specific goals and finalizing activities for these objectives.</li>

This week, a dedicated 3-day Workshop has brought together participants from key departments such as Legal, Public Safety, EU Integration, and the Minister's Cabinet. Their collective efforts are focused on shaping policies that prioritize public safety and enhance legal clarity, crucial steps towards Kosovo's integration with the European Union.
                                        We are privileged to contribute our expert insights to this significant initiative, aimed at strengthening governance and security frameworks in Kosovo.

                                        The primary purpose of the visit was to enhance the technical skills related to the most advanced investigative techniques in use by EU Police forces, in compliance with the Eu acquis, in the framework of the technical intervention of HAPE in favour of its beneficiaries aimed at improving and combatting serious organized crime in Kosovo. 
                                        The active support to the relevant institutions at the operational level will in turn support Kosovo to advance on its path towards their EU accession by providing tailored support in line with the specific needs of the partner institutions and stakeholders at national level.
                                        A safer Kosovo is a safer Europe.

Marshall. The Forum gathered high representatives of institutions from Europe, USA, and Latin America, judges, prosecutors, senior police officials, and security researchers from various prestigious universities, invited by the organizers to share a thorough presentation on the topic "Organized Crime in the Western Balkans and Regional Security". The event was a significant opportunity for the KP representatives to enhance their knowledge of the Organized crime groups (OCG), phenomena operating worldwide and to extend the network of contacts for Kosovo Police, with the view to enhance the fight against organized crime with the support of the EU institutions.</p>
