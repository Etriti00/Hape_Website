                                        The training, delivered in-person by French Expert Guilhem Giraud, brought his extensive expertise to Kosovo, focusing on key aspects of data protection in the law enforcement sector. The session was designed to equip participants—both users and prescribers—with comprehensive knowledge of Data Protection Principles, Basic Cybersecurity Countermeasures, Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs). 
                                        These vital topics were explored to ensure that all data collection and police operations align with EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
                                        A central focus of the training was on lawful procedures for intercepting communications and managing sensitive data, helping to ensure that law enforcement personnel can carry out their duties while respecting privacy and legal requirements.
                                        This initiative underscores the commitment to strengthening data protection standards within Kosovo’s law enforcement institutions, promoting accountability, transparency, and compliance with European Union standards.

                                        The purpose of the visit was to assess the current state of data protection practices and identify key training needs for MIA officials. This initiative is part of HAPE's ongoing efforts to strengthen the capacities of Kosovo’s public administration, helping them align with the EU’s standards on data protection under Chapter 24 of the EU Acquis.
                                        Together, we are working towards enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of Kosovo’s data protection framework and ensuring greater compliance with European Union standards.

                                        In this remit, the Study visit has offered a close-up view on the Institutional commitment of the most relevant actors involved in the preservation of the Territory as well as in the fight against Serious Organized Crime, to prevent the perpetration of high severity offences that might impact on the ecosystem as well as on the human health.
                                        The activity, which took place in Sabaudia at the Carabinieri Centre of Excellence for the Environmental Protection and in Rome at the Carabinieri Health Protection Department and the Carabinieri Environmental Protection and Energy Security Department, has seen involved the Ministry of Interiors, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Environment, of Kosovo, as well as the Agency for the Management of the Emergencies and the investigative units of Kosovo Police, to reflect the fact that the subject is unquestionably cross-cutting, and the approach must adapt to the shape of the threat.
                                        The EU will continue to assist Kosovo Police and the line ministry to align its capacities and legislation to EU legislation and standards.

This study visit was part of a training initiative designed to enhance the capabilities of Kosovo's forensic laboratories.
                                        Organized and funded by the Home Affairs Programme of the European Union in Kosovo (HAPE Project), this three-day visit brought together five KFA laboratory specialists from the Serology and DNA Division, the Chemical Analysis of Narcotics Division, and the Division for Analysis of Arson, Explosives, and Gunshot Residue. The primary goal was to explore training opportunities related to advanced instruments donated by the EU, facilitated by Italian forensic experts. This collaboration aimed to foster continuous forensic education, promote the exchange of knowledge, and expand practical expertise through joint activities between the two countries’ forensic institutions.
                                        The study visit followed two previous assessments conducted by the Italian Forensic Police Service at KFA laboratories, where they identified training needs for advanced laboratory equipment and assisted in developing technical standard operating procedures compliant with relevant ISO standards. A final visit is planned to implement the actual training.
                                        Participants expressed their confidence in applying the skills and knowledge gained during this training in their daily work. The KFA plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity of the Kosovo judiciary and prosecution, striving to provide accurate evidence in criminal proceedings according to the highest international and EU standards, employing advanced techniques for data interpretation in forensic cases.
                                        The EU HAPE Project continues to support the Kosovo Forensic Agency, enhancing the performance and operational capabilities of law enforcement agencies in areas such as organized crime, corruption, terrorism, and forensic science.

                                        The primary purpose of the visit was to enhance the technical skills related to the most advanced investigative techniques in use by EU Police forces, in compliance with the Eu acquis, in the framework of the technical intervention of HAPE in favour of its beneficiaries aimed at improving and combatting serious organized crime in Kosovo. 
                                        The active support to the relevant institutions at the operational level will in turn support Kosovo to advance on its path towards their EU accession by providing tailored support in line with the specific needs of the partner institutions and stakeholders at national level.
                                        A safer Kosovo is a safer Europe.
